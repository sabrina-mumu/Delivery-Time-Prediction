# Delivery Time Prediction

This is a project to predict the Delivery Time for an order. **Linear Regression** , **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Support Vector**, **Gradiant Boosting** and **Lasso Regression** models are used.

Besides, I have implemented a **Grid search** Method for the implemented models at a later state to compare their results.

Moreover, an **Ensemble Model** and **Neural Network** have been implemented.

The main steps of the Project are:

1. Dataset Download
2. Reading and Cleaning Data
3. Feature Engineering
4. Analyzing Data
5. Pre-processing
6. Applying Machine Learning models
7. Applying Grid search
8. Applying Ensemble Model
9. Applying Neural Network
